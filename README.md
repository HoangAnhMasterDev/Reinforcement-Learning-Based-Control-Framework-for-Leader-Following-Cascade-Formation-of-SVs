# Introduction
This simulation is designed to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method "Reinforcement-Learning-Based Control Framework for Leader-Following Cascade Formation of Multiple Perturbed Surface Vehicles" by comparing its performance with other existing methods:
1. [Fixed-time extended state observer-based trajectory tracking and point stabilization control for marine surface vessels with uncertainties and disturbances](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0029801819302938)
2. [An enhanced tracking control of marine surface vessels based on
adaptive integral sliding mode control and disturbance observer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019057818305421)
